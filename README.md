# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I am in my senior year of college and am hoping to land a good programming job in the future! I'm quite rusty at Github but I am hoping to change that after taking this course so I 
can start programming on big projects with a team of people in the real world. The programming languages I know are Java, C, C++, Python, and SQL. I am most familiar with Java and C.
